# Event-Management-Database

This was my final project for IST 659 Database Management class.

I was in a group with two other classmates and we were supposed to pick a real world instance or problem and built a database around the chosen topic and then using Microsoft power apps, create an interface where users can interact with the app which is connected to the database to read or write information to it. We decided to create a database centered around event management on the Syracuse University campus.
