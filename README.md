# Event-Management-Database

Final project for IST 659 Database Management class.

During this group project, my teammates and I picked a real world instance or problem and built a database around the chosen topic and then using Microsoft power apps, create an interface where users can interact with the app which is connected to the database to read or write information to it. We decided to create a database centered around event management on the Syracuse University campus where Campus organizations could post various events they were hosting and users could rsvp for various events they were interested in. 

This repository contains our database schema, SQL code to build the database including synthetic data and a powerpoint presentation.
